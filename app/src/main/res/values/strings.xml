    <string name="mountain_description">The body is in the standing position, with the feet together and rooted into the earth. The weight of the body is evenly distributed on the four corners of the feet. The pelvis is tucked. The ribcage is lifted. The neck is a natural extension of the spine and the chin is slightly tucked toward the sternum. The shoulders are relaxed as they rotate back and down. The arms at your sides. The gaze is forward.</string>
    <string name="twisted_mountain_description">From Mountain pose, one arm reaches back and the other reaches forward. The ribcage is lifted and the heart is open. The hips and knees stay squared to the front and the twist comes from the midsection. The gaze is toward the back hand, unless it hurts your neck, then the gaze can be forward.</string>
    <string name="triangle_description">From a standing position the weight of the body is distributed equally between the front and back leg. The legs are in a wide stance, parallel and scissor toward each other. The back foot is at a 45 to 60 degree angle and the front and back heels are aligned. The forward thigh is turned outward so that the center of the kneecap is in line with the center of the ankle. The torso opens toward the sky while the hips are squared as much as possible. The top hand extends up while the bottom hand is either on the earth (inside or outside the foot) or, if flexibility is limited, on a block positioned against the inner sole of the foot. From the center of the back, between the shoulder blades, the arms press away from the torso. Beginning students should keep their head in a neutral position and look forward or turn the gaze toward the earth. More experienced students can turn the head and gaze up at the top thumb as a Drishti point.</string>
    <string name="thunderbolt_description">Begin kneeling on the floor with your hips over your knees. Place your inner knees together and your thighs perpendicular to the floor. Un-tuck your toes and press the tops of your feet into the ground. Sit on your heels by resting your glutes on the soles of your feet. Keep your feet directly in line with your shins. Your feet and thighs should be touching throughout the pose. Sit up straight and draw your shoulder blades firmly against your back ribs. Widen across your collarbone and drop your shoulders away from your ears. Sit up tall and lengthen your tailbone toward the floor. Allow your arms to relax and rest your palms on your thighs. Soften your gaze.</string>
    <string name="twisted_thunderbolt_description">From Thunderbolt, take a twist. Place one palm on the ground behind your hip bone and the other across your body to the outside of the opposite knee. Sit up straight and initiate a twist from the belly, press into your grounded hanld, gaze over your back shoulder.</string>
    <string name="half_pigeon_description">From a lounging position, the hips are parallel and squared to the earth with the front knee bent in a 90-degree angle and flat on the earth. The front foot rests close to the groin. The back leg is extended with the knee and the back foot squared, parallel and pressed firmly into the earth. The ribcage is lifted. The heart is open. Fingers rest on the earth by the side body. The gaze is forward.</string>
    <string name="forward_bend_description">From a seated position with your sit bones rooted, hinge forward over your thighs and reach for your toes. Connect your lower ribs to your thighs and flatten your back even if you need to bend your knees. Wrap your index and middle fingers around your big toes and keep your chest connected to your thighs while maintaining a flat back. Internally rotate your inner thighs and pinky toes toward center. Your neck is a natural extension of your spine.</string>
    <string name="child_description">From a kneeling position, the toes and knees are together with most of the weight of the body resting on the heels of the feet. The arms are extended back resting alongside the legs. The forehead rests softly onto the earth. The gaze is down and inward.</string>
    <string name="rabbit_description">From Child\'s pose, rest the torso onto the thighs and the forehead onto the earth. Walk the knees up to meet the forehead, shifting some weight to the crown of the head. Find the maximum comfortable neck stretch and then reach back and grip the base of the feet (use a strap if necessary). To increase the stretch and come into the full expression of the pose, gradually lift or elevate your hips. Be sure to keep your forehead as close as possible to your knees and the topmost part of your skull (crown of the head) on the earth. Contract your abdominal muscles and gaze at your ankles.</string>
    <string name="camel_description">From a kneeling position the knees are hip width apart and the thighs are perpendicular to the earth. The inner thighs are narrowed and rotated slightly inward with the buttocks engaged but not hardened. The tailbone is tucked under but the hips do not puff forward. The shins and tops of the feet are pressed firmly into the earth. The ribcage is open, along with the heart center, but the lower front ribs do not protrude sharply toward the sky. The lower back lifts the ribs away from the pelvis to keep the lower spine as long as possible. The base of the palms are pressed firmly against the soles (or heels) of the feet and the fingers are pointed toward the toes. The arms are extended straight and are turned slightly outward at the shoulder joint so the elbow creases face forward without squeezing the shoulder blades together. The neck is in a relatively neutral position, neither flexed nor extended, or (for the advanced practitioners only) the head drops back. Be careful not to strain your neck and harden your throat. The gaze is either toward the sky or toward the earth, depending upon your flexibility.</string>
    <string name="bow_description">From a prone position with the abdomen on the earth, the hands grip the ankles (but not the tops of the feet) with knees no wider than the width of your hips. The heels are lifted away from the buttocks and at the same time the thighs are lifted away from the earth working opposing forces as the heart center, hips and back open. The gaze is forward.</string>
    <string name="cobra_description">Begin by lying face down with your legs extended behind you, hip-width apart and the tops of your feet rested. Spread your fingers wide and place your hands under your shoulders with your fingers pointing toward the top of the mat. Hug your elbows into the sides of your body. Press down through the tops of your feet and lift your head and chest off the floor. Keep your lower ribs on the floor. Draw your shoulders back and your heart forward keeping your head a natural extension of your spine and your shoulders rolled down and away from your ears. Begin to straighten your arms and lift your chest off the floor. Press the tops of your thighs down firmly into the floor. This is Low Cobra. Little to no weight on your hands. If your flexibility allows, you can straighten your arms all the way while maintaining the connection of the front of your pelvis and legs with the floor</string>
    <string name="wind_removing_description">From a supine position, lying on your back, the knees are bent and pulled into the chest. The arms are wrapped around the knees. The gaze is inward.</string>
    <string name="boat_description">From a seated position the feet are lifted up so that the thighs are angled about 45-50 degrees relative to the earth. The legs are straight. The tailbone is lengthened into the earth and the pubis pulls toward the navel. The shoulder blades are spread across the back and the hands reach straight forward making the arms are parallel to the earth. The chin is tipped slightly toward the sternum so that the base of the skull lifts lightly away from the back of the neck. Gaze is forward.</string>
    <string name="spinal_twist_description">From a supine position, bend one knee and cross it outside of the opposite foot. Use your hand to put slight pressure on the bent knee to push down toward the floor. Keep both shoulders squared and rooted to the earth. Extend the opposite hand and gaze toward the hand.</string>
